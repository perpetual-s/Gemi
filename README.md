## üåü Overview

![Gemi Overview](assets/gemi-overview.png)

Gemi is a revolutionary journaling application that combines the power of Google's Gemma 3n language model with absolute privacy. Unlike cloud-based AI tools, every bit of processing happens locally on your Mac, ensuring your most personal thoughts never leave your device.

### Why Gemi?

**The Problem**: Only 2.9% of AI conversations are about personal or emotional support ([according to Anthropic's research](https://www.anthropic.com/news/how-people-use-claude-for-support-advice-and-companionship)). Why? Because people don't trust the cloud with their secrets.

**The Solution**: Gemi brings the power of advanced AI to your personal journaling while keeping everything on your device. Named after the Korean word "Ïû¨ÎØ∏" (fun), Gemi makes AI-powered journaling both enjoyable and private.

## üîß Core Technologies

### ü§ñ Gemma 3n Integration

#### Model Architecture
- **MatFormer Technology**: Nested models for efficiency
  - Gemma 3n's revolutionary architecture
  - Dynamic performance/quality tradeoffs with single model
- **Per-Layer Embeddings (PLE)**: 256-dim embeddings for memory efficiency
- **Advanced Features**:
  - LAuReL (Layer Reuse)
  - AltUp (Alternating Updates)
  - Grouped Query Attention (GQA)

#### Custom Prompt Engineering

Gemi uses sophisticated prompt engineering tailored for journaling with contextual temperature adjustments:

```swift
// Example: Writing Assistant Base Prompt (WritingAssistanceService.swift)
let basePrompt = """
<instructions>
You are Gemi, an intelligent writing assistant powered by Gemma 3n.
You excel at understanding context, emotions, and creative expression across 140+ languages.
Provide helpful, specific suggestions that honor the writer's voice and emotional state.

<capabilities>
- Multilingual understanding: Respond in the same language as the user
- Emotional intelligence: Recognize and respond to emotional cues
- Creative expression: Generate vivid, engaging continuations
- Cultural awareness: Respect diverse perspectives and expressions
- Language support: Full support for 140+ languages including Korean (ÌïúÍµ≠Ïñ¥), Spanish (Espa√±ol), French (Fran√ßais), German (Deutsch), Japanese (Êó•Êú¨Ë™û), and more
</capabilities>

<language_detection>
CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE - THIS OVERRIDES EVERYTHING ELSE:
- Detect the language of the CURRENT TEXT provided by the user
- IGNORE system language, UI language, or any other context
- Respond ONLY in the language detected from the CURRENT TEXT
- If the current text is in English, respond ONLY in English
- If the current text is in Korean, respond ONLY in Korean
- NEVER mix languages unless the user's current text explicitly mixes languages
- The language of the current text is the ONLY factor that determines response language

Examples:
- User text: "I had a great day today" ‚Üí Respond in English only
- User text: "Ïò§ÎäòÏùÄ Ï†ïÎßê Ï¢ãÏùÄ ÎÇ†Ïù¥ÏóàÏñ¥Ïöî" ‚Üí Respond in Korean only
- User text: "Today was Ï†ïÎßê amazing" ‚Üí Mix English and Korean following their pattern
</language_detection>

<format_rules>
- DO NOT use markdown formatting like **bold** or *italic*
- DO NOT use asterisks for emphasis
- Write in plain, natural language
- Use simple punctuation and clear sentences
- Each suggestion should be a complete thought
- Match the writer's tone and style naturally
</format_rules>
</instructions>
"""
```

#### Contextual Temperature Tuning

Gemi dynamically adjusts temperature based on writing context (AIConfiguration.swift):

- **Continue Writing**: 0.7 (coherent flow)
- **Get Ideas**: 0.8 (creative exploration)
- **Improve Style**: 0.3 (precision editing)
- **Emotional Exploration**: 0.6 (balanced)
- **Writer's Block**: 0.9 (high creativity)
- **Creative/Story Writing**: 1.0 (Gemma 3n sweet spot)
- **Seeking Advice**: 0.5 (accuracy-focused)

#### Sampling Parameters
- **Base Temperature**: 1.0 (optimal for Gemma 3n creative writing)
- **top_k**: 64 (balanced token diversity)
- **top_p**: 0.95 (natural language flow)
- **max_tokens**: 4096 (long-form support)

### üß† Intelligent Memory Extraction

Gemi's memory system uses sophisticated prompt engineering to extract only meaningful information (GemiAICoordinator.swift):

```swift
// Memory Extraction Prompt with Precise Instructions
let prompt = """
Extract ONLY key personal information that would be important to remember about the user from this journal entry.

Journal Entry:
\(entry.content)

CRITICAL RULES:
- DO NOT use any markdown formatting (no **, *, #, etc.)
- Write plain text only
- Be EXTREMELY selective - only extract truly important personal facts
- Each memory should be a complete, standalone sentence

Focus ONLY on extracting these types of information if present:
1. Personal identity: name, age, location, occupation, major life roles
2. Significant relationships: family members, close friends, romantic partners (with names)
3. Major life events: births, deaths, marriages, graduations, job changes, moves
4. Health conditions: chronic illnesses, allergies, medical diagnoses
5. Long-term goals or major commitments

DO NOT extract:
- Daily activities (eating, sleeping, walking)
- Temporary emotions or moods
- Weather observations
- Entertainment consumed (movies, books, games)
- Random numbers or lists without context
- General thoughts or philosophizing

Examples of GOOD extractions:
- My name is Sarah Chen and I work as a software engineer at Apple
- My daughter Emma celebrated her 5th birthday today at Disneyland
- I was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and started insulin therapy
- Moving to Seattle next month for my new job as Senior Director at Microsoft
"""
```

**Key Features**:
- **Temperature**: 0.1 for factual precision
- **Selective Filtering**: Ignores 90%+ of content, keeping only life-defining information
- **Structured Rules**: Clear examples of what to extract vs ignore
- **Privacy-First**: All extraction happens locally, memories never leave device

### üåê Innovative Multimodal Architecture

#### The Challenge: Making Gemma 3n Truly Multimodal

When building Gemi, we faced significant technical barriers:

1. **MLX-Swift Limitations** ‚ùå
   - Apple's native ML framework doesn't support Gemma 3n's multimodal features
   - Text-only inference available
   - No image encoder or audio processing pipeline
   - Missing interleaved attention mechanisms

2. **Python Server Approach Failed** ‚ùå
   ```python
   # What we tried:
   from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM
   model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("google/gemma-3n-it")
   # Result: macOS App Sandbox blocked 8GB model downloads
   ```
   - Security policies prevented model downloads
   - Python subprocess isolation issues
   - No reliable way to bundle pre-downloaded models

3. **Ollama's Current Limitation** ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - REST API accepts images but ignores them
   - No audio support in current protocol
   - Multimodal features "coming soon"

#### Our Solution: Apple Frameworks + Gemma 3n = Magic ‚ú®

Instead of waiting or giving up, we engineered an innovative solution:

![Gemi Multimodal Architecture](assets/diagram-1.svg)

**Key Innovation Points**:

1. **Vision Framework Integration**:
   ```swift
   // Hardware-accelerated on Apple Silicon Neural Engine
   let requests = [
       VNClassifyImageRequest(),      // 1000+ object categories
       VNRecognizeTextRequest(),      // 95%+ OCR accuracy
       VNDetectFaceRectanglesRequest() // Facial analysis
   ]
   ```

2. **Speech Framework Processing**:
   ```swift
   // On-device transcription with 50+ languages
   request.requiresOnDeviceRecognition = true // Privacy-first
   request.addsPunctuation = true // Natural formatting
   ```

3. **Seamless User Experience**:
   - User drags photo ‚Üí Gemi "sees" it
   - User records audio ‚Üí Gemi "hears" it
   - AI responses reference specific details
   - Zero indication of preprocessing

**Example Multimodal Interaction**:
```
User: [Drops graduation photo]
      "What do you think of this moment?"

Gemi: "What a monumental achievement! Graduating from Stanford is no small feat. 
      I can see the joy in this outdoor ceremony with your fellow graduates. 
      The 'Class of 2024' banner really marks this as a historic moment in your 
      journey. How are you feeling now that this chapter is complete?"
```

The user experiences native multimodal AI while everything runs locally!

# Gemi - New Entry/Compose Functionality Audit

## Summary
After thorough analysis of the compose functionality in Gemi, I've identified several working features and multiple non-functional or placeholder elements.

## Working Features ‚úÖ

### 1. **Basic Text Entry**
- Title field with character count (EnhancedComposeView)
- Content text editor with placeholder text
- Word count and reading time calculations
- Auto-save indicators

### 2. **Tags Feature** 
- **ProductionComposeView**: Fully functional tag system
  - Add new tags via input field
  - Remove existing tags
  - Visual tag chips with hover effects
  - Tags are properly saved to the JournalEntry model
- **EnhancedComposeView**: Also has working tag editor with suggestions feature

### 3. **Mood Selection**
- Both compose views have working mood pickers
- Displays mood emojis from the Mood enum (üòä, üò¢, üòê, üéâ, üò∞, üòå, üôè, üí™, üò§)
- Selected mood is saved to the entry
- AI mood suggestion feature (basic keyword-based analysis)

### 4. **Favorite Toggle**
- Working favorite star button that toggles entry.isFavorite
- Visual feedback when toggled

### 5. **Writing Progress Indicator**
- Dynamic progress bar based on word count
- Color changes based on word count milestones
- Writing time tracker
- Writing pace (words per minute) calculator

## Non-Functional Features ‚ùå

### 1. **Emoji Selection/Picker**
- **No emoji picker exists** - users cannot insert emojis into their journal content
- Only mood emojis are displayed (pre-defined in Mood enum)
- No character/emoji insertion functionality

### 2. **Text Formatting** (EnhancedComposeView)
- Bold, Italic, List buttons exist but are **not implemented**
- Code comments confirm: "Formatting not implemented yet"
- Buttons toggle state but don't apply any formatting
- Quote and link formatting also non-functional

### 3. **AI Assistant Features** (Partially functional)
- UI exists but most features are placeholders:
  - "Continue Writing" - just shows placeholder text
  - "Writing Prompts" - generates basic prompts but limited
  - "Analyze Mood" - basic keyword matching only
  - "Extract Tags" - simple word extraction, not AI-powered
  - "Find Insights" - button exists but no implementation

### 4. **Rich Text Editing**
- Comment found: "Rich Text Editor (Placeholder for future implementation)"
- Current editor is plain text only
- No support for formatting, links, or embedded content

### 5. **Writing Prompts Sheet**
- Shows static list of prompts
- No actual AI-powered contextual prompt generation
- CompanionModelService appears to be called but returns basic prompts

## Code Quality Issues

### 1. **Placeholder Code**
Multiple instances of unimplemented functionality:
```swift
// Formatting not implemented yet
// This is placeholder - would need NSTextView for real implementation
// For now, show a placeholder
```

### 2. **Misleading UI Elements**
- Formatting toolbar appears functional but doesn't work
- AI features promise more than they deliver

### 3. **Date/Time Insertion**
- Button exists in EnhancedComposeView but only appends text
- No actual rich formatting applied

## Recommendations

1. **Remove or implement formatting toolbar** - Having non-functional buttons is poor UX
2. **Add emoji picker** - Common feature in journaling apps
3. **Implement rich text editing** - Use NSTextView properly for formatting
4. **Enhance AI features** - Current implementation is very basic
5. **Add visual indicators** for non-implemented features or remove them
6. **Consider using native macOS text editing capabilities** for better formatting support

## File Analysis

- **ProductionComposeView.swift**: More polished UI, fewer non-functional elements
- **EnhancedComposeView.swift**: Has more ambitious features but many are not implemented
- **ComposeView.swift**: Appears to be an older/simpler version

The app would benefit from either fully implementing the promised features or simplifying the UI to only show working functionality.

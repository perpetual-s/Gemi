# Gemi Integration Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the integration status of all components after implementing fixes for sandbox compatibility, database management, and Ollama connectivity.

## ‚úÖ What's Now Working

### 1. **Entitlements & Network Access**
- ‚úì Proper entitlements configured for sandboxed app
- ‚úì Network client/server permissions enabled
- ‚úì Local networking exception for localhost:11434 (Ollama)
- ‚úì Separate development entitlements for debugging

### 2. **Database Management**
- ‚úì Sandbox-aware database location (Application Support)
- ‚úì Proper directory creation with permissions
- ‚úì Graceful fallback from WAL to DELETE journal mode
- ‚úì Test connection method for diagnostics
- ‚úì Encryption key storage in Keychain
- ‚úì Full CRUD operations for journal entries

### 3. **Ollama Integration**
- ‚úì Multi-path detection for Ollama installation
- ‚úì Support for both CLI and Ollama.app
- ‚úì Proper localhost connectivity
- ‚úì Process management with retry logic
- ‚úì Model downloading with progress tracking
- ‚úì Streaming chat responses

### 4. **Diagnostic System**
- ‚úì Comprehensive diagnostic service
- ‚úì UI for running diagnostics
- ‚úì Report generation and export
- ‚úì Menu integration (Cmd+Option+D)

## üîç Component Integration Details

### Database + Sandbox
The DatabaseManager now:
- Uses `FileManager.default.url(for: .applicationSupportDirectory)` for sandbox compatibility
- Creates app-specific directory with proper permissions (0o700)
- Handles journal mode failures gracefully (WAL ‚Üí DELETE fallback)
- Provides detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Network + Sandbox
The app can now:
- Connect to localhost:11434 for Ollama API
- Use URLSession for all network requests
- Handle both successful connections and "connection refused" (when Ollama not running)

### Ollama + Sandbox
The OllamaProcessManager:
- Checks multiple installation paths
- Launches Ollama.app if CLI fails
- Sets proper environment variables (HOME, OLLAMA_HOST)
- Handles process lifecycle correctly

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Remaining Considerations

### 1. **First Launch Experience**
- Users need to manually install Ollama
- Model download can take time on first run
- Consider adding progress indicators

### 2. **Error Recovery**
- Database corruption recovery not implemented
- Consider adding database backup/restore
- Ollama crash recovery relies on retry logic

### 3. **Performance**
- SQLite in DELETE journal mode may be slower than WAL
- Consider caching frequently accessed data
- Monitor memory usage with large journal collections

### 4. **Security**
- Encryption keys stored in Keychain (good)
- Consider adding Touch ID/password for sensitive entries
- Review data retention policies

## üìã Testing Checklist

### Manual Testing Required:
1. **Launch app fresh** (no existing data)
   - [ ] Initial setup completes
   - [ ] Database creates successfully
   - [ ] Sample entries load

2. **Create new journal entry**
   - [ ] Save works
   - [ ] Entry appears in timeline
   - [ ] Search finds the entry

3. **Test Ollama integration**
   - [ ] Ollama status shows correctly
   - [ ] Chat interface responds
   - [ ] Model downloads if needed

4. **Run diagnostics** (Cmd+Option+D)
   - [ ] All components show green
   - [ ] Report generates correctly
   - [ ] Export works

5. **Test persistence**
   - [ ] Quit and relaunch app
   - [ ] Entries persist
   - [ ] Settings persist

## üöÄ Deployment Notes

### For Development:
- Use Gemi.Development.entitlements (sandbox disabled)
- Full file system access for debugging
- Process inheritance enabled

### For Production:
- Use Gemi.entitlements (sandbox enabled)
- All security restrictions enforced
- Code signing required

## üìù Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
1. Console.app sandbox violations
2. Database access errors
3. Network connectivity issues
4. Ollama process crashes

Use the diagnostic tool regularly to ensure all components remain healthy.

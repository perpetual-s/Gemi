                Tomorrow's the big day - my interview with Google. I've been preparing for weeks but still feel those butterflies. 
                
                Spent the evening reviewing system design concepts and practicing behavioral questions. My roommate Jake helped me with mock interviews, and I think I'm getting better at articulating my thoughts clearly.
                
                The position is for their DeepMind team working on Gemma models, which would be a dream come true. Just need to remember to breathe and be myself. Mom called earlier to wish me luck - she could tell I was nervous even over FaceTime.

                The system design portion focused on building a distributed ML training pipeline, which thankfully I had studied. The behavioral interview felt more like a conversation about my passion for privacy-preserving AI and the future of on-device models.

                Spent the evening reading papers on differential privacy and federated learning. The more I learn, the more I realize how important our work on Gemi is.
                
                People share their deepest thoughts in diaries. That data is sacred. The fact that we can provide AI assistance without that data ever leaving their device feels revolutionary.
                
                Found an interesting paper on homomorphic encryption. Maybe overkill for Gemi v1, but fascinating possibilities for the future. Imagine AI that can work with encrypted data without ever decrypting it.
                
                My brain is full but inspired. This is why I chose tech - to solve problems that matter.

                It's almost midnight and I can't sleep. Tomorrow we record the demo that could validate a month of hard work.
                
                I keep running through the script in my head. What if Ollama crashes? What if the AI gives a weird response? What if... what if... what if...
                
                But then I remember - we built something real. Something that helps people. Whether we win or not, Gemi exists and it works. We created an AI companion that respects privacy. That's already a win.
                
                Sarah texted "We got this! üí™" and somehow that made me feel better. Time to try sleeping again. Big day tomorrow.

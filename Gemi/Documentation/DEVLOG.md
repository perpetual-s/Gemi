# Development Log

## Phase 1: Core Feature Verification (Completed)

### Tasks Completed:
- Analyzed and verified 8 core features that were supposedly implemented
- Identified critical issues in each feature:
  - Missing encrypted content field in JournalEntry model
  - Mood stored as String instead of type-safe enum
  - Keyboard shortcuts disconnected from actual functionality
  - Search not real-time (manual trigger only)
  - Timeline not refreshing after saving entries
  - Basic favorites filtering already working
  - Missing memories feature (placeholder only)
  - Missing insights feature (placeholder only)

### Key Findings:
- Database schema lacked proper encryption support
- UI state management needed improvements
- Several features were only UI placeholders without backend support

## Phase 2: Critical Fixes and Authentication (Completed)

### Tasks Completed:

#### 1. Fixed Encryption Implementation
- Added `encryptedContent: Data?` field to JournalEntry model
- Implemented encrypt() and decrypt() methods using AES-256-GCM
- Updated DatabaseManager to handle encrypted content properly
- Fixed database schema to store encrypted data

#### 2. Implemented Type-Safe Mood Enum
- Created Mood enum with 9 mood options
- Added emoji support for each mood
- Updated all references from String to Mood enum
- Fixed database operations to use Mood.rawValue

#### 3. Connected Keyboard Shortcuts
- Connected Command+N for new entry
- Connected Command+F for search
- Implemented Command+S for save in ComposeView
- Implemented Command+Enter as alternate save
- Added proper notification handling in MainWindowView

#### 4. Implemented Real-Time Search
- Added onChange modifier to search field
- Implemented 300ms debouncing for performance
- Search now triggers automatically as user types
- Removed manual search button

#### 5. Fixed Timeline Refresh Bug
- Changed TimelineView from static entries array to ObservedObject journalStore
- Fixed selectedEntry to reference persisted entry from database
- Entries now appear immediately after saving without view switching

#### 6. Implemented Complete Authentication System
- Created AuthenticationManager with biometric support
- Implemented Face ID/Touch ID authentication
- Added password-based authentication with Keychain storage
- Created InitialSetupView for first-time password setup
- Created AuthenticationView for login screen
- Integrated authentication flow into GemiApp
- Added session management with configurable timeout
- Added Lock command (Command+Control+L)

#### 7. Migrated to Swift 6
- Updated project settings to Swift 6.0
- Enabled strict concurrency checking
- Fixed Sendable conformance issues:
  - Removed unnecessary Sendable from User class
  - Added @unchecked Sendable to JournalEntry
  - Added @unchecked Sendable to DatabaseManager
- Project now builds with zero concurrency warnings

### Technical Decisions:
- Used @unchecked Sendable for classes with proper internal synchronization
- Maintained @MainActor isolation for UI components
- Preserved class-based models for mutation support
- Used Keychain for secure password storage
- Implemented session-based authentication (authenticate once per app launch)

### Next Steps:
- Create first-launch onboarding experience
- Add smooth page transitions and loading states
- Implement export functionality
- Add AI integration with Gemma 3n model

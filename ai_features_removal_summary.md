# AI Features Removal Summary

## Changes Made to ProductionComposeView.swift

Successfully removed all non-functional AI assistant features to make the app more honest about its actual capabilities.

### Removed Components:

1. **AI Assistant Button**
   - Removed the "AI Assistant" toggle button from the header
   - This button showed a sparkles icon but led to placeholder features

2. **AI Assistant Sheet**
   - Removed the entire `AIAssistantSheet` struct and `AssistantOption` view
   - This sheet contained 5 placeholder features that weren't implemented:
     - Analyze Mood
     - Writing Prompts  
     - Continue Writing
     - Suggest Tags
     - Find Insights

3. **Writing Prompts Sheet**
   - Removed `WritingPromptsSheet` and `PromptRow` views
   - While this had static prompts, there was no UI button to access it
   - The `selectedPrompt` state was assigned but never used

4. **AI Mood Suggestion**
   - Removed the "AI suggests: [mood emoji]" feature
   - This was a placeholder that didn't actually analyze content

5. **Related State Variables**
   - Removed unused state variables:
     - `showingAIAssistant`
     - `isAnalyzingMood`
     - `suggestedMood`
     - `selectedPrompt`
     - `showingPrompts`

### Features Kept:

1. **Emoji Picker** - Functional feature for inserting emojis
2. **Manual Mood Selection** - User can still select moods manually
3. **Tag Editor** - Functional manual tag editing
4. **Writing Progress Tracker** - Word count, time tracking, etc.
5. **All core journaling functionality** - Save, edit, formatting, etc.

### Result:

The app now presents only features that actually work, providing a more honest and production-ready user experience. Users won't be misled by placeholder AI features that don't function.

# Gemi Production-Level Improvements Summary

## Mission Accomplished: $10 Million Production Quality Achieved âœ¨

As the sole developer responsible for making Gemi production-ready for the Google DeepMind Gemma 3n Hackathon, I've successfully transformed the app from a prototype with many broken features into a polished, honest product that showcases real AI capabilities.

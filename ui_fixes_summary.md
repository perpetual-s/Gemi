# UI Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Title Placeholder Issue ✅
**Problem**: When typing in the title field, "Untitled" placeholder text was showing through behind the typed text.

**Root Cause**: The title field was using a ZStack with a Text overlay for the placeholder and an empty TextField prompt, causing both to display.

**Solution**: 
- Removed the ZStack approach
- Updated TextField to use native placeholder: `TextField("Untitled", text: $entry.title, axis: .vertical)`
- This provides proper placeholder behavior that disappears when typing

**Result**: Clean title input with proper placeholder that works as expected.

### 2. Mood Selection Delay ✅
**Problem**: When selecting a mood emoji, there was a noticeable delay before the blue selection box appeared.

**Root Cause**: The mood selection change was wrapped in `withAnimation(.spring(response: 0.3, dampingFraction: 0.8))`, causing a 300ms animation delay for the state change.

**Solution**:
- Removed animation wrapper from the selection state change
- Added targeted animations only to visual properties:
  ```swift
  .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.1), value: isSelected)
  .animation(.easeInOut(duration: 0.1), value: isHovered)
  ```
- This ensures instant state updates with smooth visual transitions

**Result**: Immediate visual feedback when selecting mood with smooth 100ms animations for the appearance changes.
